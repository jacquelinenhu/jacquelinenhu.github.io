Hello! I'm Jacqueline! I grew up in Southern California but moved to South Korea and Texas for university. I really enjoy studying Data Analytics and Data Science, hence why I'm furthering my education right now. :)

I began the M.S. Data science program at SMU in 2025 two years after graduating with a B.S. Data Analytics.
